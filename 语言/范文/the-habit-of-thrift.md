Dear editor,

    Many colleage students have no concept of thrift in their mind. They take it for granted that they spend the money provided by their parents before they enter into the society.

    The extravagant speeding is primarily caused by the following factors. First of all, nowdays many colleage students are the only child of their families. They are the apple of their families' eyes and get more care and pocket money. In addition, with the improvement of living standards, parents can afford more expenditure on their children.

    From the point of view, as a colleage student, as a pure consumer, we should limit our expenditure on daily neccessities and not buy whatever we want regardless of price. The habit of thrift can help us from the right values and is favorable to our future development.

Yours truly
Li Ming
