## From Haskell Tutorial

> an "almost-functional" language such as ML or Scheme.

> Examples of expressions include atomic values such as the integer 5, the character '5', and the function
\x -> x + 1

it means the function in Haskell is an atomic value.

> The "::" can be read as "has type".

> The static type system ensures that the Haskell programs are type safe.

> Function `head` returns the first element of a list, function `tail` returns the all but the first.

The result type of function `head` is the type the element, but the result type of function `tail` is a list.

> We can define our own type in Haskell using a `data` declaration.
